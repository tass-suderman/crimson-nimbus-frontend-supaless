# The Legendary Cloud Guardian

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/Nt2BJBN/Cloud-Guardian-logo.png)

Fork of the Crimson Nimbus frontend repository.
This version fixes a few bugs present in the original, and uses Discord OAuth2.0 rather than Supabase.

Google Cloud elements are not included in this fork by default.

For environment variables, include the following:

REACT_APP_FETCH_BASE: The URL of the backend server.

REACT_APP_DISCORD_LOGIN_URL: The OAuth URL generated by Discord. Include identity scope and ensure it returns a token rather than a code. Redirect goes to (frontend server URL)/login
